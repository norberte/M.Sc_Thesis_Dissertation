     % This ignores the valuable coder-related part-who are the top experts (geek talents) in a specific area? This information is important to companies, open source projects, and to those who want to learn from an expert role model. Thus, how to find the right developers is quite a crucial yet challenging problem. Most of the current works mainly focus on recommending experts in a particular software engineering task and ignore the relationship between developers within different projects
