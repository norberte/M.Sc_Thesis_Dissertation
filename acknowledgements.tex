I, Norbert Eke, would like to express my sincere gratitude to my amazing supervisor, Professor Olga Baysal, for her continuous guidance, advice, and friendly discussions throughout my thesis. Our joint vision for this project, her continuous efforts in providing me with valuable feedback and support made this work successful. 

I am very grateful to my family - my parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts and uncles. They gave me tremendous amount of support by motivating, encouraging me and keeping me optimistic in difficult moments.

I am thankful to my friends and girlfriend for their patience, optimism, support, and encouragement when I needed it the most, especially during the writing process. 

I would like to acknowledge the advice of several professors: Prof. Majid Komeili, Prof. Ahmed El-Roby and Prof. Abram Hindle. I would also like to be grateful for the help of my colleagues in the Data Science Lab at Carleton University, and the 20 students from COMP5117 (Mining Software Repositories), Fall 2019 semester who volunteered for the \emph{Expertise Ground Truth Human Annotation Study}. Without their professional opinion on expertise the ground truth study would have not been possible.
