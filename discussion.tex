    \section{Findings\label{sec:findings}}
    
    % based on the whole study what did you learn?
    % what was the most surprising, most interesting
    % don't look at the results individual
    % how data affects the modeling
    
    % check with Christof's paper about data quality and how it influences the topic modeling
    
    % Compare results to Christoff
        % ----> our approach is more focused on model interpretability and usefulness
        % ----> task basked evaluation vs. not necessarily useful, meaningless metrics
        % ----> quote Abram's chapter about agreeing with him on task based evaluation
        % ----> that's why we evaluate on extraction of expertise

        %\cite{boyd2014care} states that ''problems with topics could be: 
        %    \begin{enumerate}
        %        \item Contains too general and specific words
        %        \item Contains mixed and chained topics
        %        \item Identical topics
        %        \item Nonsensical topics
        %        \item Contains "stop-word-like" words
        %    \end{enumerate}
