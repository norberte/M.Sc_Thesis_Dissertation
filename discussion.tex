\cite{boyd2014care} states that ''problems with topics could be: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Contains too general and specific words
        \item Contains mixed and chained topics
        \item Identical topics
        \item Nonsensical topics
        \item Contains "stop-word-like" words
    \end{enumerate}
